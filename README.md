Welcome to my humble abode! You may be wondering why my profile is a bit empty. Well, let me tell you a secret...

I'm actually a professional code ninja who spends most of my time saving the world one line of code at a time. But don't worry, I'll be sure to add some of my top secret projects soon.

In the meantime, feel free to check out my mad skills in:
- Programming Languages: HTML, CSS, JavaScript/TypeScript, Go.
- Technologies: React.js, Vue.js, Angular, Next.js, Nuxt, MongoDB, Postgresql, Go, MobX, Redux, Node.js, SQL, Docker, k8s.
- Methodologies: Agile, Scrum, Test-Driven Development, Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD), Behavior Driven Development (BDD).

So, if you need help with anything, feel free to contact me. But, be warned, I'm also a bit of a comedian and tend to make bad jokes.
